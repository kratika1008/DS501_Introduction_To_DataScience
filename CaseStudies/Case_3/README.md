# Case Study 3: Identifying Uber demand in New York (Python3)

## Goal:
Predict the likeliness of a recession using historical financial data (given no significant external impact).

## Problem Statement:
- Identify areas in NYC with highest Uber demand
- Identify the demand based on Week day and hour of the day

## Data Pre-processing:
- Used Uber 2014 NYC dataset for the analysis
- Collected a set of Uber trips for the period of 6 months and identified their pickup locations
- Reviewed the pickup date/time


## Analysis:
- Used k-means clustering to identify various boroughs
- Concluded with the borough with the maximum demand
- Found the busiest hour of the day and the busiest day of the week for Uber drivers

## Results:
Summarized the analysis to help Uber drivers know about the busiest pickup location across NYC, along with the best day and time to be there to expect frequent rides

## Requirements:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- folium
- sklearn
- geopy
